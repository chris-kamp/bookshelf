# Bookshelf
The Odin Project - "Library" assignment

# Learning outcomes
I practiced the use of object constructors and prototypes in Javascript, as well as DOM manipulation and dynamically creating and
styling elements. I also continued to practice basic visual design and CSS to attempt to create a visually appealing and functional
user interface.

# Room for improvement
There are a number of areas that could be improved if I were to devote further time to this project. For example:
- Implement local and/or remote storage.
- The visual design and layout could be improved. A more appealing font could be used, layout and spacing of cards could be improved to reduce blank space, etc.
- Additional fields could be added, eg. to give a rating to books.
- Code for re-indexing after deleting cards could be improved. Iterating over all elements is probably not the most efficient way to accomplish this.
